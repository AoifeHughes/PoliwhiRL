"""Process-based vectorised wrapper around PyBoyEnvironment.

Each worker process owns one PyBoyEnvironment instance with its own
per-instance temp directory (handled by the env itself). Workers auto-reset
on done so the main loop can collect fixed-length rollouts across N envs
without having to track episode boundaries inside the wrapper.

Uses the 'spawn' multiprocessing context for portability (macOS default,
also safer than 'fork' for libraries that initialise SDL/threads on import).
