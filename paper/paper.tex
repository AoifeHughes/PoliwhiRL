\section{Methodology}

The RainbowDQN model integrates several enhancements to the traditional Deep Q-Network (DQN), combining them into a unified architecture that addresses various limitations observed in earlier models. This section outlines the mathematical foundations of the RainbowDQN model, focusing on its convolutional layers, dueling network structure, and the application of NoisyNet for exploration.

\subsection{Model Architecture}

The RainbowDQN model employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to process pixel-based input from game screens. The network architecture is designed to extract features from the input image through multiple convolutional layers, each followed by a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. The output of these layers is then flattened before being passed to the subsequent components of the network.

\subsubsection{Convolutional Layers}

Given an input image $x \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times H \times W}$, where $C$, $H$, and $W$ represent the channels, height, and width of the image respectively, the convolutional layers transform the input as follows:

\[
f(x) = \text{ReLU}(W * x + b)
\]

where $*$ denotes the convolution operation, $W$ represents the weights of the convolutional filters, and $b$ is the bias term.

\subsubsection{Feature Size Calculation}

The dimensionality of the output from the final convolutional layer is determined by the function:

\[
\text{feature\_size}(input\_dim) = \text{Flatten}(\text{ConvLayers}(0_{input\_dim})).size
\]

This function is crucial for determining the input dimension of the fully connected layers that follow.

\subsection{Dueling Network Architecture}

The RainbowDQN model utilizes a dueling network architecture, which consists of two streams that estimate the value and advantage functions separately:

\[
V(s) = \text{ValueStream}(f(s))
\]
\[
A(s, a) = \text{AdvantageStream}(f(s))
\]

The final Q-value is computed by combining the value and advantage streams:

\[
Q(s, a) = V(s) + (A(s, a) - \frac{1}{|\mathcal{A}|} \sum_{a'} A(s, a'))
\]

where $|\mathcal{A}|$ is the number of actions. This architecture allows the model to learn which states are (or are not) valuable, independent of the actions taken.

\subsection{Noisy Linear Layers for Exploration}

Exploration is facilitated through Noisy Linear layers, which introduce randomness into the decision-making process, enabling the model to explore different strategies. The operation of a Noisy Linear layer with input $x$ is given by:

\[
y = (W_{\mu} + W_{\sigma} \odot \epsilon^w) x + (b_{\mu} + b_{\sigma} \odot \epsilon^b)
\]

where $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication, $\epsilon^w$ and $\epsilon^b$ are noise vectors sampled from a normal distribution, and $W_{\mu}, W_{\sigma}, b_{\mu},$ and $b_{\sigma}$ are the parameters of the layer representing the mean and standard deviation of the weights and biases, respectively.

\subsection{Distributional RL}

The RainbowDQN model adopts a distributional approach to reinforcement learning, representing the return of a policy as a distribution rather than a single expectation. The support of this distribution is discretized into a fixed number of atoms, and the model predicts the probability of each atom for the returns. The distribution is given by:

\[
\text{Dist}(s, a) = \text{softmax}(\text{Value} + \text{Advantage} - \text{AdvantageMean})
\]

This distribution is then used to compute the expected Q-values by summing over the product of the probabilities and their corresponding atom values, $\text{support}$, which is linearly spaced between $V_{min}$ and $V_{max}$.

By combining these mathematical principles, the RainbowDQN model provides a robust framework for learning optimal policies in complex environments, such as sprite-based 2-D Pokémon games.
